DCRA is the District of Columbia's Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. DCRA's mission is to protect the health, safety, economic interests and quality of life of residents, businesses and visitors in the District of Columbia by ensuring code compliance and regulating business.

DCRA supports a thriving community of residents, businesses, and visitors through diligent protection of health and safety and equitable administration of regulation and compliance in our District. 

DCRA has been growing at a record pace, and so has the demand for required inspections by the agency. DCRA is embracing alternative solutions that will decrease the wait in scheduling and reduce the inefficiencies of existing solutions. Currently, there are 68 full-time inspectors, and the forecast for demand is approaching 150,000 inspections per year.
