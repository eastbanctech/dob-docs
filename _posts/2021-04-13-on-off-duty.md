Once the Inspector logs in, a popup message appears on the screen

By selecting On Duty button, the app displays an active Schedule and current Assignment page

However, if the Inspector selects Not Now button, the App allows the Inspector to view the Schedule and Assignment page, but not to work on any assignments because the Inspector cannot work on assignments when they are Off Duty and therefore the Schedule and Assignment pages are greyed out, i.e. they are inactive

As soon as the Inspector turns the toggle switch On Duty, the Schedule and the Assignment page become active and the Inspector can begin working on assignments
