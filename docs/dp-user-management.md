# User Management <sup class="new">NEW</sup>

Users who have been provisioned with [User Admin role](../docs/dp-user-management.html#user-roles) have access to the User Management functionality through in the Dispatch Portal. The User Management feature allows for updates to a user's role, which has an impact on level of access and other permissions described below. User Management is accessed via the main navigation menu (outlined in red below).

### Add New User

User Admins have the ability to add users to the Dispatch system. Selecting Add New User triggers a modal window allowing the creation of a new Dispatch user. Once all required fields are satisfied, selecting Add User confirms the action. 

* Users must exist in Access DC and be assigned to the DOB Dispatch application in Access DC.
    * If User is meant to be an Inspector of any kind, they also must have a profile in Accela set up with the same email address used in Access DC.
* Creating a new user triggers an invite email that is sent to the provided email address and adds the user to the User List with status "Invited."
* After the new user logs in for the first time the system will automatically move them to "Active."
* Invitations can be resent from the User Permissions Details Page only when the user has the "Invited" status.

<section id="access-dc-account-email-address" markdown="1">

#### Access DC Account Email Address

An active Access DC email account is required to add a new user to Dispatch. The user undergoes specific provisions when added on Access DC side. The process is different for users with personal email addresses not affiliated with dc.gov and should reach out to DOB management to resolve that.

If a user is to be set up as an Inspector (see roles below), the user must have a profile set up in Accela as well with the same email used for Access DC.

2. **Manager** - has access to all Portal pages including Reports and can edit Inspector Settings, but no access to User Management functionality.

#### Department

Selecting a department designates the types of inspections Inspectors can get assigned. 

* Department is an optional field for users designated as Inspectors.
* Managers and Portal Users are not required to have a Department, but if one is selected, it would serve as a pre-selected filter for Portal pages.
    * Exception: Reports are embedded from Power BI and therefore don't have a dependency on the selected Department and it must be selected manually.
* If Inspector is categorized as a Duty Officer, then the Duty Officer should be assigned to all available Department they are expected to conduct an inspection in.

3. **External Inspectors** - Inspectors that are Resident Inspectors or other 3rd party inspectors

<section id="inspection-availability-hours" markdown="1">

#### Inspection Availability Hours

* Inspector's Hours should be added of when an Inspector is expected to conduct inspections. 
* Duty Officers can have 24 hour availability as they are not assigned regular inspections.
* External Inspectors can have 24 hour availability as well and use absences to modify their availability.
    * Currently External Inspectors even if provisioned in Dispatch will not receive any inspections.

Inspectors availability can be adjust by designating what days are available via the checkbox to the left of the day and the hours the user is available via the start and end timeframe dropdowns. To indicate the Inspector is off on specific days, a checkbox should be unselected and "No Availability" will be displayed.
