# On Duty and Off Duty
Inspectors have the ability to use the Dispatch app while both on duty and off duty, with difference in mode, Active vs. Inactive. 

<section id="on-duty" markdown="1">

## On Duty
Once logged in, Inspectors see a popup, that allows them to indicate their on duty status so that their location can be reported to DOB.

### Schedule in Active Mode

By selecting On Duty button, the Schedule triggers Active mode, where Inspectors can interact with assignments and add Absences.

## Off Duty

If Inspectors select the "Not Now" button, the Schedule and Current Assignment page remain Inactive and are greyed out. Inspectors are able to view their Schedule but cannot interact with it or Current Assignment page.

## Switching Between Off Duty and On Duty
As soon as Inspectors turn the toggle switch to On Duty, the Schedule and the Current Assignment page become Active and Inspectors can begin working on assignments.
