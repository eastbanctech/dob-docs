This page is the Detailed Assignment page and although it provides all the details, the Inspector cannot work on it because it's not the Current Assignment. The Inspector, however, can Request to Reschedule or Cancel the Assignment from this page

Once an assignment is completed, the system will add additional details regarding the status from Accela.
